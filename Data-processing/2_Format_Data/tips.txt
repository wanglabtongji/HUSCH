1. If sone barcodes are quoted by double quotes, remember to remove them.
2. For plain file, the column names should be barcodes while the row names are gene symbols. Sometimes you may need to transpose or remove numeric row names, etc.
3. If it is a rdata or rds file, read the file in and take out the raw data slot before going to the subsequent processing.
4. When the file is too large, it is faster to process it with the data.table package.
6. If there are many files from same source, you need to merge them together. Remember to add the prefix when merging, which usually are the GSM number.
7. When merging different count data, convert all of them to h5 files and then merge them to reduce errors.
8. Sometimes you need to split the file, for example, a set of data has different organizational sources, it will be faster to use mtx file to split.
